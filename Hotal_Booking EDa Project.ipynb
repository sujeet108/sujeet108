As we further moved we find unique value of each columns and generate a list in tabular form and also check the dataset type of each columns find some columns not in accurate data types which correct it later done in Data cleaning part and as well as duplicates data items must be removed as we find duplicates items equal to 87396 which is dropped from dataset later.\n",
